That is a fantastic question. You've pinpointed the most subtle but important detail of using docxtpl with rich text.

The direct answer is: No, a RichText object does not automatically inherit the styling of the {{r placeholder}} it replaces.

Let me explain why, and then provide the robust and correct solution.

The "Why": Understanding How docxtpl Works

Simple Placeholder ({{ my_text }}): When you use a simple placeholder, docxtpl finds that text and replaces it. The new text inherits the styling (font, size, color, etc.) of the first character of the placeholder text. It's a simple text replacement within a single XML "run" in the document.

Rich Text Placeholder ({{r my_richtext }}): When you use a rich text placeholder, you are telling docxtpl: "Delete the entire paragraph that contains this placeholder and, in its place, insert this brand new block of content that I have constructed in my RichText object."

Because the RichText object is a completely new element, it does not know what the style of the old placeholder was. By default, it will be inserted with the document's "Normal" style, or whatever explicit styling (like bolding) you defined when creating it in your Python code.

The Solution: Using Named Styles

The professional and correct way to solve this is to decouple the content from the presentation by using named styles in your Word template. You define the style once in Word, and then tell your Python code to apply that specific style by name.

This is a two-step process:

Step 1: Create Custom Styles in Your Word Template

This is a one-time setup in your .docx template files.

Open bbh_hdqt_template.docx (and nghi_quyet_template.docx).

Go to the Home tab in Word. Find the Styles pane (you may need to click the small arrow in the corner of the Styles gallery).

Click the "Create a Style" or "New Style" button.

Create a new style for your main content body.

Name: BodyContent (use this exact name, no spaces).

Style type: Paragraph.

Formatting: Set the font, size (e.g., Calibri, 11pt), spacing, indentation, etc., that you want for your main paragraphs.

Click OK.

Create another new style for your bullet points.

Name: ListContent

Style type: Paragraph.

Formatting: Set the same font/size, but also click Format -> Numbering and choose the bullet point style you want.

Click OK.

Now your template has two custom styles that your code can refer to. You don't even need to apply them to the placeholders; they just need to exist in the document.

Step 2: Modify the Python Code to Apply These Styles

We will enhance the add_markdown_to_doc utility to accept style names as arguments. This makes it incredibly powerful and reusable.

Here is the updated code for app/utils.py.

# in app/utils.py
import re
from docxtpl import RichText

# No changes needed here
def add_markdown_to_doc(doc, markdown_text: str, default_style='Normal', bullet_style='List Bullet') -> RichText:
    """
    Converts a Markdown string into a RichText object for docxtpl,
    applying specific named styles from the Word document.

    Args:
        doc: The DocxTemplate object (needed for style context).
        markdown_text: The string containing Markdown.
        default_style (str): The name of the style for regular paragraphs.
        bullet_style (str): The name of the style for list items.

    Returns:
        RichText: The formatted object ready for rendering.
    """
    rt = RichText()
    lines = markdown_text.strip().split('\n')
    
    for line in lines:
        line_strip = line.strip()
        if not line_strip:
            continue

        # Check if the line is a list item
        is_bullet = False
        if line_strip.startswith(('* ', '- ')):
            is_bullet = True
            # Remove the markdown for the bullet
            content = line_strip[2:]
        else:
            content = line_strip

        # Split by bold tags to handle bolding within the line
        parts = re.split(r'(\*\*.*?\*\*)', content)
        
        # We need to add the content first to create a paragraph, then apply the style
        # Add a temporary flag to apply style after adding content
        paragraph_added = False
        
        for part in parts:
            if not part: continue
            paragraph_added = True
            if part.startswith('**') and part.endswith('**'):
                rt.add(part[2:-2], bold=True)
            else:
                rt.add(part)
        
        # Add the paragraph break and apply the correct style
        if paragraph_added:
            rt.add('\n')
            if is_bullet:
                rt.paragraphs[-1].style = bullet_style
            else:
                rt.paragraphs[-1].style = default_style
            
    return rt

Now, update the service that calls this function to pass in the new style names.

Here is the updated code for app/services/document_generator.py:

code
Python

content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# in app/services/document_generator.py
# ... (imports) ...
from app.utils import add_markdown_to_doc

# ... (inside generate_templated_document function) ...
def generate_templated_document(template_type: str, llm_json_output: str) -> BytesIO:
    # ... (code to load template and JSON context) ...

    try:
        doc = DocxTemplate(template_path)
        context = json.loads(llm_json_output)

        # Process fields that contain Markdown into RichText objects
        for key, value in context.items():
            if isinstance(value, str) and value.startswith("[Markdown]"):
                markdown_content = value.replace("[Markdown]", "").strip()
                
                # --- CHANGE IS HERE ---
                # Pass the custom style names to our utility function.
                # Now the generated text will have the exact style you defined in Word.
                context[key] = add_markdown_to_doc(
                    doc,
                    markdown_content,
                    default_style='BodyContent', # Your custom style for paragraphs
                    bullet_style='ListContent'   # Your custom style for bullets
                )
                # --- END OF CHANGE ---

        doc.render(context)
        
        buffer = BytesIO()
        doc.save(buffer)
        buffer.seek(0)
        return buffer

    # ... (exception handling) ...
Summary of the Benefit

By following this approach:

Your styling is controlled entirely within the Word template. If you want to change the font for all generated content, you just edit the BodyContent style in the .docx file. You don't need to change any Python code.

Your code is clean and maintainable. The logic is simple: "For this placeholder, generate the content and apply the 'BodyContent' style."

You get perfect consistency. All generated paragraphs and lists will look exactly as you designed them in Word, creating a highly professional final document.
